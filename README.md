# Database Connectivity 
We can integrate **Django** with an **SQLite3 database** to store bill-related data efficiently. The database keeps records of all bills, including their **payment status** (paid or pending). Additionally, any updates made to the table, such as bill payments, will be **dynamically reflected** in real-time, ensuring that the latest status is always displayed.
